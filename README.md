# SQL-Capstone-Project---Airline-DB

Opportunity to work extensively with a real-time airline database, applied my skills in data analysis and database management to extract valuable insights. Utilizing PostgreSQL as the primary querying tool, I proficiently crafted and executed complex SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the database. These queries ranged from simple data retrievals to more intricate joins and aggregations to meet diverse analytical needs. One of the key aspects of involved solving real-time queries and challenges faced by stakeholders, such as flight scheduling optimization, passenger demand forecasting, and route profitability analysis. Furthermore, I conducted in-depth analysis on various aspects of airline operations, including ticket sales trends, on-time performance metrics. Through meticulous data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques, I transformed raw data into actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive strategic initiatives.
